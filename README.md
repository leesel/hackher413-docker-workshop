# Hack(H)er413 Docker Workshop

This is a demo React application that can be used to demonstrate how to use Docker and Docker Compose.
The application was started from https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit.

## What you need
- This repository
- Docker (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)


## Workshop
1. Clone the repository or download the code. We'll pretend we are working on
a task to dockerize the application to get it ready to deploy to a cloud environment.
2. This application uses MongoDB. To run it locally, we'll want to setup MongoDB.
An easy way to do this is by using Docker. It is fairly easy to find official Docker images
for well known software like MongoDB. Open up your command line or terminal and
enter the following:
```
docker pull mongo:latest
```
This will pull down the latest MongoDB docker image for you to use locally. You can see
more details about this image at https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo.
3. Once step 2 has completed, let's try running it!
```
docker run --name homeward-mongo â€“d mongo:latest
```
This command will run the docker image in detached mode in the background.
Next, let's execute some commands inside the container to observe how it is
an isolated container from the host OS:
```
docker exec -it homeward-mongo /bin/bash
```
Feel free to do an `ls` to see what's there! It's not your host.

Let's check out the mongo cli:
```
mongo
```
Once you get the prompt do:
```
show dbs
```
You should see the default mongo databases.
4. Let's go back to the app for a moment...Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of the project. The file will literally
be called "Dockerfile".
5. First, we will start by creating the build image:
```
FROM node:10 as build
WORKDIR /app-install

# Copy the repo to the image
COPY . .

# Install Node.js dependencies
RUN yarn install --no-progress

# Build the code - transpile with babel
RUN yarn run build --release

# Prune dev dependencies
RUN yarn install --production --ignore-scripts --prefer-offline
```
This is the first part of our image! Nice!
6. Let's build the next part which will produce a production ready image.
This should go right under step 3 in "Dockerfile".
```
FROM node:10
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy artifacts from our build step image
COPY --from=build /app-install/build/ .
COPY --from=build /app-install/node_modules/ ./node_modules/

# Set permissions for "node" user
RUN chown -R node:node /usr/src/app
RUN chmod 755 /usr/src/app

# Run the container under "node" user by default
USER node

# Set NODE_ENV env variable to "production" for faster expressjs
ENV NODE_ENV production

# Start up the app
CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]

```
We've just written a mutli-stage build Dockerfile. (https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)
7. Now, let's see if it works! Run the following on the command line in the directory of the project:
```
docker build -t homeward-app .
```
It will may take a bit to complete depending on the internet.
8. Now that we have build our image, let's try to run it.
```
docker run -it homeward-app
```
You should see an error related to MongoDB connection.
9. Let's connect our two Docker containers together. Since we ran the mongo
image in detached mode, let's kill the image so we can reconfigure how it's running.
```
docker container stop homeward-mongo
docker container rm homeward-mongo
```
10. We will now create a docker network:
```
docker network create homeward-network
```
11. Re-start the mongo image:
```
docker run --name homeward-mongo -d --net homeward-network mongo:latest
```
12. ...And let's also run the app image. We will expose port 3000 so that
we can access the application in our browsers. We will also pass in a value
for the app environment variable `DATABASE_URL` so the container knows how
to find MongoDB on the docker network. It is addressable by the value we set
for `--name`. In this case `homeward-mongo` will resolve to the IP of the 
MongoDB container.
```
docker run --name homeward-app -d --net homeward-network -p 3000:3000 -e "DATABASE_URL=mongodb://homeward-mongo:27017/homeward" homeward-app:latest
```
13. Let's check that the docker images are running successfully by opening
http://localhost:3000
